# Optimism Monorepo Contributing Guide

## What to Contribute

Welcome to the Optimism Monorepo Contributing Guide!
If you're reading this then you might be interested in contributing to the Optimism Monorepo.
Before diving into the specifics of this repository, you might be interested in taking a quick look at just a few of the ways that you can contribute.
You can:

- Report issues in this repository. Great bug reports are detailed and give clear instructions for how a developer can reproduce the problem. Write good bug reports and developers will love you.
  - **IMPORTANT**: If you believe your report impacts the security of this repository, refer to the canonical [Security Policy](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.
- Fix issues that are tagged as [`D-good-first-issue`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/labels/D-good-first-issue) or [`S-confirmed`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/labels/S-confirmed).
- Larger projects are listed on [this project board](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/9). Please talk to us if you're considering working on one of these, they may not be fully specified so it will reduce risk to discuss the approach and ensure that it's still relevant.
- Help improve the [Optimism Docs] by reporting issues or adding missing sections.
- Get involved in the protocol design process by joining discussions within the [OP Stack Specs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/discussions) repository.

### Contributions Related to Spelling and Grammar

At this time, we will not be accepting contributions that primarily fix
spelling, stylistic or grammatical errors in documentation, code or elsewhere.

Pull Requests that ignore this guideline will be closed,
and may be aggregated into new Pull Requests without attribution.

## Code of Conduct

Interactions within this repository are subject to a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/).

## Development Quick Start

### Setting Up

Clone the repository and open it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
cd optimism
```

### Software Dependencies

You will need to install a number of software dependencies to effectively contribute to the
Optimism Monorepo. We use [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/) as a dependency manager for these tools.
Once properly installed, `mise` will provide the correct versions for each tool. `mise` does not
replace any other installations of these binaries and will only serve these binaries when you are
working inside of the `optimism` directory.

#### Install `mise`

Install `mise` by following the instructions provided on the
[Getting Started page](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#_1-install-mise-cli).

#### Trust the `mise.toml` file

`mise` requires that you explicitly trust the `mise.toml` file which lists the dependencies that
this repository uses. After you've installed `mise` you'll be able to trust the file via:

```bash
mise trust mise.toml
```

#### Install dependencies

Use `mise` to install the correct versions for all of the required tools:

```bash
mise install
```

#### Installing updates

`mise` will notify you if any dependencies are outdated. Simply run `mise install` again to install
the latest versions of the dependencies if you receive these notifications.

### Building the Monorepo

You must install all of the required [Software Dependencies](#software-dependencies) to build the
Optimism Monorepo. Once you've done so, run the following command to build:

```bash
make build
```

Packages built on one branch may not be compatible with packages on a different branch.
**You should rebuild the monorepo whenever you move from one branch to another.**
Use the above command to rebuild the monorepo.

### Running tests

Before running tests: **follow the above instructions to get everything built**.

#### Running unit tests (solidity)

```bash
cd packages/contracts-bedrock
just test
```

#### Running unit tests (Go)

Change directory to the package you want to run tests for, then:

```shell
go test ./...
```

#### Running e2e tests (Go)

See [this document](./op-e2e/README.md)

#### Running contract static analysis

We perform static analysis with [`slither`](https://github.com/crytic/slither).
You must have Python 3.x installed to run `slither`.
To run `slither` locally, do:

```bash
cd packages/contracts-bedrock
pip3 install slither-analyzer
just slither
```

## Labels

Labels are divided into categories with their descriptions annotated as `<Category Name>: <description>`.

The following are a comprehensive list of label categories.

- **Area labels** ([`A-`][area]): Denote the general area for the related issue or PR changes.
- **Category labels** ([`C-`][category]): Contextualize the type of issue or change.
- **Meta labels** ([`M-`][meta]): These add context to the issues or prs themselves primarily relating to process.
- **Difficulty labels** ([`D-`][difficulty]): Describe the associated implementation's difficulty level.
- **Status labels** ([`S-`][status]): Specify the status of an issue or pr.

Labels also provide a versatile filter for finding tickets that need help or are open for assignment.
This makes them a great tool for contributors!

[area]: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/labels?q=a-
[category]: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/labels?q=c-
[meta]: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/labels?q=m-
[difficulty]: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/labels?q=d-
[status]: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/labels?q=s-

### Filtering for Work

To find tickets available for external contribution, take a look at the https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/labels/M-community label.

You can filter by the https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/labels/D-good-first-issue
label to find issues that are intended to be easy to implement or fix.

Also, all labels can be seen by visiting the [labels page][labels]

### Modifying Labels

When altering label names or deleting labels there are a few things you must be aware of.

- If the https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/labels/S-stale label is altered, the [close-stale](.github/workflows/close-stale.yml) workflow should be updated.
- If the https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/labels/M-dependabot label is altered, the [dependabot config](.github/dependabot.yml) file should be adjusted.
- Saved label filters for project boards will not automatically update. These should be updated if label names change.

## Workflow for Pull Requests

ðŸš¨ Before making any non-trivial change, please first open an issue describing the change to solicit feedback and guidance. This will increase the likelihood of the PR getting merged.

In general, the smaller the diff the easier it will be for us to review quickly.

In order to contribute, fork the appropriate branch, for non-breaking changes to production that is `develop` and for the next release that is normally `release/X.X.X` branch, see [details about our branching model](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/README.md#branching-model-and-releases).

Additionally, if you are writing a new feature, please ensure you add appropriate test cases.

Follow the [Development Quick Start](#development-quick-start) to set up your local development environment.

Read any README files in the packages you are contributing to. Some packages have additional instructions that are not covered in this guide.

We recommend using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format on commit messages.

Unless your PR is ready for immediate review and merging, please mark it as 'draft' (or simply do not open a PR yet).

Once ready for review, make sure to include a thorough PR description to help reviewers. You can read more about the guidelines for opening PRs in the [PR Guidelines](docs/handbook/pr-guidelines.md) file.

**Bonus:** Add comments to the diff under the "Files Changed" tab on the PR page to clarify any sections where you think we might have questions about the approach taken.

### Response time

We aim to provide a meaningful response to all PRs and issues from external contributors within 2 business days.

### Rebasing

We use the `git rebase` command to keep our commit history tidy.
Rebasing is an easy way to make sure that each PR includes a series of clean commits with descriptive commit messages
See [this tutorial](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/git_rebase.html) for a detailed explanation of `git rebase` and how you should use it to maintain a clean commit history.
